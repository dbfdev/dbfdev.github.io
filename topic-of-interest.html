<p><b>Since 2006</b>, when I was having some english classes with a teacher who knows something about <i>very basic HTML</i>, I got some initial tips to start some webpages ideas I had in that period. Few years later I was trying to study english in a paper, trying to write many times the words, and doing some paper memory games to try to remember the meaning of some words and then I realyzed that a digital game can make my learning much funnier and I will be able to let other people to use my game too and maybe even earn some money with the game. My project was started and day by day I was progreeding, learning about programming and English and it was really fun! I really enjoyed to do the game. Unfortunatelly I didn`t had much time to dedicate to this project, because I had to work and study in other things and then I abandon the project, but the game still online and helping hundreds of people to learn english every day.</p>

<p>These are some screenshots of the <i>game</i>:</p>

<p>And this is the url to the game that <u>still available</u>: <a href="http://www.inglesgratisonline.com.br" target="_blank">

<p>I stopped to work on this project but I never forget this and other ideas, and this was not only a thing that I liked to do, but a way to work and have a good income with that because the website was kind of successfully and it reached thousands of people everyday before I did some mistakes that took it down in the Google SEO, like broken links, unfinished levels, poor optimization, etc.</p>

<p>And the english game wasn`t my only project. Before the english game I worked hard in my spare time during years in a website that listed hotels and other hosting places. This website reached thousands of new visitors every day, but unfortunatelly this website isn`t available anymore because I stopped paying the url to avoid problems for don`t do propperly updates to the hotels information in the website. I think I reached more than 10,000 places registered.</p>

<p> I had made some other websites and games later on too, and some of then still available, like another game to teach people about the states and citios of Brazil, as can be seen on this url: <a href="http://www.superguia.info/jogobrasil01.php" target="_blank">

<p>So, the gamification is a hobby to me and now I see the opportunity to make it my proffession too. I really enjoy the idea to became a programmer to be able to earn money doing what I like to do and I believe that providing games for free will not be the most profitable way to earn money doing that, but I really believe that I will be able to reach a huge amount of the people of the entire world providing free games and earning a little of money just by advertisements and it can really change the world.</p>
